### Frontend 
You can register and login. I also have created custom hook for getting user location using Geolocation api.
Redux has been used for state management.

### Backend
Backend is connected with MongoDB Atlas. Consist of User model with auth route which consists of register and login routes.
After login the user gets an accesstoken (jsonwebtoken) which can be used for enhanced authentication.
